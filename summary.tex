\chapter{Summary and Conclusions}

The purpose of this thesis was the technical analysis of existing PoS implementations. Based on the findings the goal was to design and implement a PoS protocol and convert the Bazo blockchain from PoW to the new system. Using a PoS consensus mechanism, the system becomes environmentally friendly and more secure against the 51\% attack for a less established cryptocurrency. 

The chain-based approach as well as the Byzantine agreement protocols were thoroughly studied. A chain-based PoS protocol approach was chosen out of simplicity of this type of protocol. Several different designs were created and in-depth discussed with the supervisors until a secure design was established. 

The implemented random election process is unique and proposes a higher degree of security than the PPCoin implementation. The technical requirements towards the newly designed PoS consensus algorithm were delivered. The evaluation chapter discussed security considerations for the PoS based system.
