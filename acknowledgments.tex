I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Thomas Bocek for the continuous support of my Bachelor's Thesis. His patience, motivation and profound knowledge in the field of blockchain technology is inspiring. 

Besides my supervisors I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Burkhard Stiller, the head of the Communication Systems Research Group, for giving me the opportunity to work on such an interesting and currently relevant topic.
